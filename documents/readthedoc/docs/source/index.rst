Welcome to Confidential Computing Zoo's documentation!
======================================================

Confidential Computing Zoo (CCZoo) is an open source to provide confidential computiong
solutions based on Intel technologies below.

- Intel® Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology
  - Intel® Software Guard Extensions (Intel® SGX).
    Intel® SGX 1/2 offers hardware-based memory encryption that isolates specific
    application code and data in memory. Intel® SGX allows user-level code to
    allocate private regions of memory, called enclaves, which are designed to
    be protected from processes running at higher privilege levels. Only Intel®
    SGX offers such a granular level of control and protection.
    For more information, please refer to [Intel® SGX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/software-guard-extensions.html).
  - Intel® Trust Domain Extensions (Intel® TDX).
    Intel® TDX is introducing new, architectural elements to help deploy hardware-isolated,
    virtual machines (VMs) called trust domains (TDs). Intel TDX is designed to isolate
    VMs from the virtual-machine manager (VMM)/hypervisor and any other non-TD software
    on the platform to protect TDs from a broad range of software. For more infermation,
    please refer to [Intel® TDX](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/intel-trust-domain-extensions.html).
- Intel Homomorphic Encryption Acceleration Library (HEXL) (In Planning)


CCZoo is not limited to provide various reference implementation based on Intel® TEE technology,
but also provide the solution driven, easy adoption, scalable best pactices to help users in:
- Having an overall understaning of an End-to-End solution based on Intel® TEE.
- Quick adoption or reference under similar senarios in CCZoo with security design based on Intel® TEE.

CCZoo provides confidential computing best practices with below features:
- Whole Flow Data Security
  - Runtime Security
  - In-Transit Security
  - At-Rest Security
- Application Integrity
  - Remote Attestation
- Full Coverage Data Security
  - Input query, output score, model
- Elasticity(Optional)
  - Kubernets

To let users reproduce the solutions easily with mninal porting effoert, CCZoo adopts LibOS
to protect applications from a malicious system stack. The main LibOS we adopted is [Gramine](https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine)
and [Occlum](https://github.com/occlum/occlum). CCZoo also deloy the each solutions
with containerization dockerfile. Users can follow each documents of the solutions to reproduce
it.

CCZoo is a growing project and we have a growing contributor and maintainer community.
Our goal is to continue this growth in both contributions and community adoption.
